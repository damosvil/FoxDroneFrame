# FoxDroneFrame
This is a 5 inch Floss Light frame to be used with EMAX 1606 4000kv motors, GF5125 or EMAX AVAN scimitar 5x2.6x3 props, 1100mah batteries and 20x20mm stacks. All meassures are in millimeters.

Top plate is 2mm thick, bottom plate is 3mm thick, arms and reinforcements are 4mm thick.

This setup is 190 grams dry weight (no battery) and about 340 grams with 1100mah 4s battery.

The motors max pull are 1040 grams each, so for this setup the max pull is 12 times the weight.

During my tests I tried fiberglass reinforcements, because at a const of 30% of extraweight they offer better performance in terms of combined resistance to crashes.
